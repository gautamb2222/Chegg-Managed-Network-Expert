# Chegg-Managed-Network-Expert

Hey everyone
This is Gautam Bansal, a Electrical Engineering undergraduate from class of 2024 in IIT Kanpur.

This repository majorly includes all of my experiences while working as a **Managed Network Expert** at Chegg India, How to apply for this job, and what are the feilds you might apply for :

## EXPERIENCE
I am now working at CHEGG India for the last 5 months and the experience is great. As a student, I want my own mental peace to cope up with my studies and this job never felt like a extra burden to me. I am just doing my own work and when I get brain start to saturate from constant supply of same subject, I open the Chegg Portal and do some 3-4 random problems. This is a lot helpful in increasing knowledge base also. It is not always the case that you might know the solution to the problem as it is certainly a good level of **Advanced Mathematics** and **Advanced Physics** problem as in my case. As the questions appear at random, sometimes they go out of topic too but don't worry, you can checkout some reading for the topic on google and answer it. I found a lot of questions from **Finance** and **Mortgages** and **Economics** and a lot other areas which also interests me a lot and thus I explored them to answer which was a great plus to my knowlege in these ares. The thing that I can use the portal anytime to answer gave me a lot of flexibility and just fitted to me as a perfect job.

## How it works ?
It is basically your account, where you have to log in and start answering the questions. You can upload your solutions writing on a paper, or type them(generally preferred). You answers will be reviewed and according to positive ratings on your solutions and number of questons you solve will decide your payouts.

## How to become a expert at Chegg ?
In my case, I listened about Chegg from a friend and I **googled** about **Chegg Expert**. You can make a new account there and will have to follow a bunch of steps that includes a test from your preffered subject area. The test is tough though give it a try. After all the steps completed, Chegg starts to hire their selected applicants near **End of the Year**. Yes, you will have to wait that long. ***Mine account was activated 5 months after I applied for the job***. 

## Payouts
Chegg pays a fairly decent or I can say a good amount of money that a student might need to fulfil its daily expenses. They pay us around **100 to 300 ruppees** per question. Daily doing a single question can give a fairly good Pocket Money and a **lot of knowledge**.
